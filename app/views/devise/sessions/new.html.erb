      <h2>Chair Lift.</h2>
      <p>Chair Lift is an easy way to find a ride to the mountain.  The idea is simple,  Not everyone has a car, this is targeting college students
      and city dwellers.  Also, driving solo can be really boring and expensive.  Chair Lift gives a driver the ability to post a "Lift"
      and interact with other users in our chat feature.  This app isn't intended to be mind blowing, it's just a setting for like minded people
      help eachother out.  All gas price negotiations, pickups, times etc will be negotiated in your lift description and the chat. </p>

      <p>We want our users to be safe, so we ask that you sign in with facebook.</p>
